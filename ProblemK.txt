Problem: Pirate Navigator

Problem Description	The crew needs help traversing the numerous obstacles in the vast ocean. The map indicates an obstacle by denoting it as a 'x', and clear water is denoted with a '.'. The starting position is indicated with an 'C', and the destination also with a 'C'. Determine the number of times the ship must turn in order to reach the destination.

Notes	Assume that the crew's initial direction is unknown, and that the ship cannot travel diagonally. A turn is defined as every time the ship must change its direction.

Input	Line 1: Two space-separated integers x and y, the coordinates of the map
Line 2...y+1: c_i, the character on the map, either an 'x' or '.'

Output	Line 1: The number of turns the ship must make
