Problem: Pirate Buffet

Problem Description	The captain has ordered the crew mates to watch their calories. However, the captainâ€™s method of enforcing this is not always efficient. Indeed, the chef instead makes separate servings of varying calories. Help the crewmates find the optimal meal that yields the closest calories to their original intake without exceeding this value.

Notes	Hint: it is not always optimal to choose the largest serving

Input	Line 1: two space-separated integers, C and S, the number of calories originally consumed and the number of servings
Line 2: C_i, S space-separated integers indicating the number of calories in each serving

Output	The most number of calories the crew can consume without going over their original intake..
